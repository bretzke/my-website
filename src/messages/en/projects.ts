      "This project was built with Next.js using Shadcn/UI for the component library and Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, an API integration with Stripe was implemented to display the products registered on the platform and to create payment links through the API. For managing the shopping cart state, Zustand was used, allowing me to validate my knowledge in this powerful library through this project.<br></br><br></br><i>Note: The payment link is in test mode, to complete it use a test card that Stripe provides in its documentation: <link>https://docs.stripe.com/testing</link></i>",
